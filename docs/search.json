    "text": "My overarching research interest relates to the dynamics of discourse– how different aspects of language fluctuate over time. Basically, much of my research examines how linguistic properties in text or spoken discourse change across time.\nExamples of discourse contexts I’ve researched: groupchats between students in an ed tech platform, lyrics, Trader Joe’s product reviews, books from Project Gutenberg, movie script dialogues, subreddit discussion, reflective/informal writing, interactions between strangers over Zoom, think-alouds produced during reading, and March Madness press conference transcripts\nExamples of linguistic features I’ve examined: sentiment, cohesion, swearing, reflection/metacognition, sourcing, topics/semantic spaces, academic language, bursts/pauses in keystrokes, gendered language, turn-taking"
